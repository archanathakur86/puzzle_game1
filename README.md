# Project Title: Puzzle Maze

## Project Overview

Puzzle Maze is a browser-based interactive puzzle game designed to test and improve users' logical thinking and problem-solving skills. The gameplay is organized in a level-wise and room-wise format, where users progress by solving puzzles in a fixed sequence. Players earn points, receive hints, and face time-bound challenges as they advance through the game.

## Project Objective

The goal of Puzzle Maze is to create a fun, structured, and educational puzzle-solving experience that:

- Promotes focused problem-solving under constraints like time and order.
- Teaches players the importance of step-by-step progression by enforcing a strict puzzle sequence.
- Provides a sense of achievement by unlocking levels, earning points, and receiving immediate feedback.
- Allows replayability, where users can revisit puzzles and get fresh challenges.

## Game Structure & Flow (Planned Design)

### Level 1: Starter Puzzle

- Contains 1 simple puzzle.
- Introduces users to basic gameplay and rules.
- No timer in this levelâ€”beginner-friendly.
- Players must complete this puzzle to unlock Level 2.
- A hint system is available to assist players if needed.

### Level 2: Main Challenge

- Consists of 2 rooms.
- Each room contains 4 puzzles (8 puzzles total).
- Puzzles must be solved in a specific order.
- If a player tries to access a later puzzle without solving the current one, they see a message like:  
  *"Please solve the previous puzzle first."*

### Key Features in Level 2

- **Timer:** Each puzzle has a 30-second countdown displayed on the screen.
- **Hints:** Available for each puzzle to assist players.
- **Points System:** Players earn points for each puzzle solved.
- **Dynamic Puzzles:** Replaying a previously solved puzzle presents a new, randomly selected question from a question pool.

## Core Game Features (Planned)

- Level-wise and room-wise progression.
- Puzzle unlocks only after the previous puzzle is solved.
- Timer system for each puzzle (except Level 1).
- Hints to support players when stuck.
- Alert messages guiding players to maintain correct puzzle order.
- Points awarded upon solving puzzles (Level 2).
- Dynamic content that changes puzzles upon replay.

## Why This Project?

Puzzle Maze combines fun, logic, and learning by:

- Helping users develop structured and logical thinking skills.
- Providing an engaging way to challenge the brain.
- Offering a clear learning path through fixed progression.
- Being suitable for all ages due to its simple logic and replay value.
